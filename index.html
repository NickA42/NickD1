Hello World
<h>
  The Harm of Non-Electric Cars 
  </h>
  <p>
    As many people know, our Ozone layer is diminishing more and more everyday. This is largely because of the consumption of gasoline from cars. Recent research suggests that if we do not make a change now with our pollution prevention efforts, our world will be unfit for all life by 2050. There are also many alternatives that we KNOW we can use but just don't because the big name oil companys only car about the money. People go to war over something that is literally going to kill us. We have the perfect source of fuel and its been shining its light on us since the beginnning of time. Electric cars are the solution that people are too selfish to see and if we do not make the switch soon, it will be too late for redemption.
